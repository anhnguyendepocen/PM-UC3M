Notes for *Predictive Modeling*
===============================

Course overview
---------------

These are the notes for *Predictive Modeling* for the course 2017/2018. The subject is part of the [MSc in Big Data Analytics](https://www.uc3m.es/ss/Satellite/Postgrado/en/Detalle/Estudio_C/1371210340413/1371219633369/Master_in_Big_Data_Analytics) from [Carlos III University of Madrid](http://www.uc3m.es/).

The notes are available at <https://bookdown.org/egarpor/PM-UC3M>.

The course is designed to have, roughly, **one lesson and one lab for each main topic** in the syllabus. The schedule is tight due to time constraints, which will inevitably make the treatment of certain methods a little superficial compared with what it would be the *optimal*. Nevertheless, the course will hopefully give you a great panoramic view of different available methods for predictive modeling.

Here is a broad view of the **syllabus**:

1.  [Introduction](https://bookdown.org/egarpor/PM-UC3M/intro.html) (first lesson)
2.  [Linear models I](https://bookdown.org/egarpor/PM-UC3M/lm-i.html) (first/second lesson)
3.  [Linear models II](https://bookdown.org/egarpor/PM-UC3M/lm-ii.html) (second/third lesson)
4.  [Linear models III](https://bookdown.org/egarpor/PM-UC3M/lm-iii.html) (third/fourth lesson)
5.  [Generalized linear models](https://bookdown.org/egarpor/PM-UC3M/glm.html) (fifth lesson)
6.  [Nonparametric regression](https://bookdown.org/egarpor/PM-UC3M/npreg.html) (sixth lesson)

<!-- 7.  [Generalized additive models](https://bookdown.org/egarpor/PM-UC3M/gam.html) (seventh lesson -- skipped) -->

The **office hours** are **Thursdays from 19:15 to 20:15**, at the classroom in which the lab took place. Make use of them!

**Questions and comments** during lectures are mostly welcome! So just go ahead and fire. Especially if these are clarifications, comments or alternative perspectives that may help the rest of the class.

The **course evaluation** guidelines can be found [here](https://bookdown.org/egarpor/PM-UC3M/app-evaluation.html).
